0. Fork me if you can!
mandatory
In the industry, you will work on an existing codebase 90% of the time. Your first thoughts upon looking at it might include:

“Who did this code?”
“How it works?”
“Where are unittests?”
“Where is this?”
“Why did they do that like this?”
“I don’t understand anything.”
“… I will refactor everything…”
But the worst thing you could possibly do is to redo everything. Please don’t do that! Note: the existing codebase might be perfect, or it might have errors. Don’t always trust the existing codebase!

For this project you will fork this codebase:

update the repository name to AirBnB_clone_v2
update the README.md with your information but don’t delete the initial authors
If you are the owner of this repository, please create a new repository named AirBnB_clone_v2 with the same content of AirBnB_clone

Repo:

GitHub repository: AirBnB_clone_v2

1. Some tests won’t be relevant for some type of storage, please skip them by using the skipIf feature of the Unittest module - 26.3.6. Skipping tests and expected failures. Of course, the number of tests must be higher than the current number of tests, so if you decide to skip a test, you should write a new test!

How to test with MySQL?
First, you create a specific database for it (next tasks). After, you have to remember what the purpose of an unittest?

“Assert a current state (objects/data/database), do an action, and validate this action changed (or not) the state of your objects/data/database”

For example, “you want to validate that the create State name="California" command in the console will add a new record in your table states in your database”, here steps for your unittest:

get the number of current records in the table states (my using a MySQLdb for example - but not SQLAlchemy (remember, you want to test if it works, so it’s better to isolate from the system))
execute the console command
get (again) the number of current records in the table states (same method, with MySQLdb)
if the difference is +1 => test passed


2. Console improvements
mandatory
Update the def do_create(self, arg): function of your command interpreter (console.py) to allow for object creation with given parameters:

Command syntax: create <Class name> <param 1> <param 2> <param 3>...
Param syntax: <key name>=<value>
Value syntax:
String: "<value>" => starts with a double quote
any double quote inside the value must be escaped with a backslash \
all underscores _ must be replace by spaces . Example: You want to set the string My little house to the attribute name, your command line must be name="My_little_house"
Float: <unit>.<decimal> => contains a dot .
Integer: <number> => default case
If any parameter doesn’t fit with these requirements or can’t be recognized correctly by your program, it must be skipped
Don’t forget to add tests for this new feature!

Also, this new feature will be tested here only with FileStorage engine.


3. MySQL setup development
mandatory
Write a script that prepares a MySQL server for the project:

A database hbnb_dev_db
A new user hbnb_dev (in localhost)
The password of hbnb_dev should be set to hbnb_dev_pwd
hbnb_dev should have all privileges on the database hbnb_dev_db (and only this database)
hbnb_dev should have SELECT privilege on the database performance_schema (and only this database)
If the database hbnb_dev_db or the user hbnb_dev already exists, your script should not fail


4. MySQL setup test
mandatory
Write a script that prepares a MySQL server for the project:

A database hbnb_test_db
A new user hbnb_test (in localhost)
The password of hbnb_test should be set to hbnb_test_pwd
hbnb_test should have all privileges on the database hbnb_test_db (and only this database)
hbnb_test should have SELECT privilege on the database performance_schema (and only this database)
If the database hbnb_test_db or the user hbnb_test already exists, your script should not fail



5. Delete object
mandatory
Update FileStorage: (models/engine/file_storage.py)

Add a new public instance method: def delete(self, obj=None): to delete obj from __objects if it’s inside - if obj is equal to None, the method should not do anything
Update the prototype of def all(self) to def all(self, cls=None) - that returns the list of objects of one type of class. Example below with State - it’s an optional filtering



6. DBStorage - States and Cities
mandatory
SQLAlchemy will be your best friend!

It’s time to change your storage engine and use SQLAlchemy

In the following steps, you will make multiple changes:

the biggest one is the transition between FileStorage and DBStorage: In the industry, you will never find a system who can work with both in the same time - but you will find a lot of services who can manage multiple storage systems. (for example, logs service: in memory, in disk, in database, in ElasticSearch etc…) - The main concept behind is the abstraction: Make your code running without knowing how it’s stored.
add attributes for SQLAlchemy: they will be class attributes, like previously, with a “weird” value. Don’t worry, these values are for description and mapping to the database. If you change one of these values, or add/remove one attribute of the a model, you will have to delete the database and recreate it in SQL. (Yes it’s not optimal, but for development purposes, it’s ok. In production, we will add “migration mechanism” - for the moment, don’t spend time on it.)
